# Esp32-RTC-based-motion-detection-using-PIR-sensor
To develop a system to develop a cost-effective, compact, and efficient system capable of detecting motion in real time. Utilizing the ESP32-CAM module equipped with an OV2640 camera sensor, this project integrates motion detection, real-time clock (RTC) for timestamping, and a web server for remote monitoring and control.
